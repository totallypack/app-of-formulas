APP OF FORMULAS
OVERVIEW:
There are a growing number of people in this modern world that don't really get the chance to get their hands dirty anymore. People have lost touch with how things in the physical world works. And while chemistry or metallurgy might be super boring to a highschooler a lot of people grow up and wish they had more real-world knowledge.

This app aims to make this knowledge more obtainable. Here is a compilation of working formulas that range from how to make cheese to how to brush brass. And a user doesn't have to rely on random chance to find something they are interested in, the user can learn new things based on a specific hobby even if they didn't know what they needed to look for first.

This app hopes to educate and remove some of the mystery from the world that surrounds us, because understanding lifts us all up.

DESCRIPTION OF USER:
The ideal user of this app is someone who wants to learn how the world around them works. The ways they can do that include:
Allowing several users to create and share formulas.
Keep up with their hobbies and discover knwledge related to it.
The user has full customization of their own formulas.
The user can learn about new things every time they log in with a Random Formula feature.

LESSONS LEARNED:
Learned to keep things labeled.
I learned a new way to read/write. https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write
Learned about using @extend which enables me to write more semantic HTML markup. Instead of adding multiple Bootstrap utility classes directly in my HTML I can define a custom class in my CSS and extend the desired Bootstrap class.
Learned a lot more about CSS.
Learned a little more about hooks.
Learned a more detailed data structure in firebase that allows multiple people to hold a "favorites" status with a given object at the same time.
