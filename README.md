APP OF FORMULAS
OVERVIEW:
There are a growing number of people in this modern world that don't really get the chance to get their hands dirty anymore. People have lost touch with how things in the physical world works. And while chemistry or metallurgy might be super boring to a highschooler a lot of people grow up and wish they had more real-world knowledge.

This app aims to make this knowledge more obtainable. Here is a compilation of working formulas that range from how to make cheese to how to brush brass. And a user doesn't have to rely on random chance to find something they are interested in, the user can learn new things based on a specific hobby even if they didn't know what they needed to look for first.

This app hopes to educate and remove some of the mystery from the world that surrounds us, because understanding lifts us all up.
